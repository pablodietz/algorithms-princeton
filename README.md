# Algorithms - Princeton Course
Programming assignments from Princeton University algorithms course.


Assignment                    | Chalenge
:-----------------------------|------------
[Percolation](percolation)    | Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
[Queues](queues)              | Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.
[8-puzzle](8puzzle)           | Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
[Collinear](collinear)        | Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
[KdTree](kdtree)              | Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
[Event Driven](event-driven)  | Write a program to simulate the motion of N colliding particles according to the laws of elastic collision using event-driven simulation.
