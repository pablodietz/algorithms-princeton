# Event Driven

Simulate the motion of N colliding particles according to the laws of elastic collision using event-driven simulation. Such simulations are widely used in molecular dynamics (MD) to understand and predict properties of physical systems at the particle level. This includes the motion of molecules in a gas, the dynamics of chemical reactions, atomic diffusion, sphere packing, the stability of the rings around Saturn, the phase transitions of cerium and cesium, one-dimensional self-gravitating systems, and front propagation. The same techniques apply to other domains that involve physical modeling of particle systems including computer graphics, computer games, and robotics.
